# The Sorting Hat is a magical talking hat at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The hat decides which of the four "Houses" each first-year student goes to:

# ü¶Å Gryffindor
# ü¶Ö Ravenclaw
# ü¶° Hufflepuff
# üêç Slytherin


# Write a program that asks the user some questions with the int() and input() functions:

# Q1) Do you like Dawn or Dusk?
#     1) Dawn
#     2) Dusk

# If answer is equal to 1, Gryffindor and Ravenclaw both get a +1.
# Else if answer is equal to 2, Hufflepuff and Slytherin both get a +1.
# Else, output the message "Wrong input."
# Q2) When I‚Äôm dead, I want people to remember me as:
#     1) The Good
#     2) The Great
#     3) The Wise
#     4) The Bold

# If the answer is 1, Hufflepuff +2.
# Else if answer is 2, Slytherin +2.
# Else if answer is 3, Ravenclaw +2.
# Else if answer is 4, Gryffindor +2.
# Else, output the message "Wrong input."
# Q3) Which kind of instrument most pleases your ear?
#     1) The violin
#     2) The trumpet
#     3) The piano
#     4) The drum

# If the answer is 1, Slytherin +4.
# Else if the answer is 2, Hufflepuff +4.
# Else if the answer is 3, Ravenclaw +4.
# Else if the answer is 4, Gryffindor +4.
# Else, output "Wrong input."
# Lastly, print out the score for each house.
